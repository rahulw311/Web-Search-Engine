# Web-Search-Engine
A comparative study of a built-in ranking algorithm(lucene) vs a ranking algorithm implemented from scratch.

Please make sure all the required libraries are installed and the dependencies are imported.

To run the project perform the following steps-

1. Run the index_searcher java file in order to set up lucene search for Java Gateway.
2. Run the searcher.py file for executing the flask app and click on the link to run the web server.
3. Enter the search query and hit the button in order to search the files.
4. The top results should load on the results.html file in a minute or so.

BM25 is the ranking algorithm that has been implemented from scratch in this project.
